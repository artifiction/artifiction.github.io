        <h4> J.R.R. Tolkien</h4>
        <p>
            John Ronal Reuel Tolkien, the author of the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> and its related works, was born on January third, 1892, in Bloemfontein. His parents were Arthur and Mabel Tolkien. They moved to England when he was three years old, where he was raised after the death of his father by his mother with her parents. He was homeschooled by Mabel, who taught him botany, latin, and other subjects. She died when he was twelve, leaving him in the the guardianship of Friar Francis Xavier Morgan.
            </br></br>
            He attended King Edward's School, located in Birmingham. In his youth, his fascination with language deepened through invented languages. He studied at Exeter College, initially in classics, then in English Language and Literature.
            </br></br>
            He engaged Edith Bratt when he was 21, and married in 1916, during the beginning of World War I. He became a commissioned officer, and was summoned to France in June of 1916. Due to sickness, he returned to England later that year, and many of his friends perished in the war while he recovered in England. It was during this time of recovery that he began work on works that would shape and inspire his later series. He worked at the Oxford English dictionary, then at the University of Leeds. He also worked at Pembroke College, where he wrote <em>The Hobbit, The Two Towers,</em><em> and The Fellowship of the Ring</em>. After World War II, he moved to Merton College. He retired in 1959, and die fourteen years later in 1973.

        <h4> Sophocles</h4>
        <p>
            Sophocles, author of <em>Ajax</em> was likely born in the Greater Athens area at an uncertain year between 497 and 496 BCE. He died in his 90's. As a result, he lived through the primacy and fall of Athens as a Greek power. After his first victory in the City Dionysia of 468 BCE (Athens' premier dramatic festival) he won 18 additional ones, and was one of the pre-eminent playwrights and tragedians of his age. Only seven of his 120 plays survive.
